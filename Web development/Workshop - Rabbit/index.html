            <h2>Basic info</h2>
            <p>
                Rabbits are little creatures with
                <em>long ears and puffy tails</em>, and they move their nose <br>up and down in an adorable way. 
                They eat the most orange vegetables in our <br> world, and they <b>reproduce more than any human ever has.</b> 
                <h2>Songs</h2> 
                    <em>Little Bunny Foo Foo</em>, <br>I don't want to see you <br>scooping up the field mice <br>and bopping them on the head!
